# Delays

Flight delays are coded for company performance evaluation and trend analysis. This project looked at what caused initial delays and how to recover them for better on-time performance.

The focus of the exploration was on the type of delay and in which airports they were occuring. By reorganizing the flight records, I was able to determine that many delays were not coded or were given a generic code of "late in, late out", despite additional delay time being added.

I worked with the department heads of the airport staff and IT to find the loopholes in the process where this was occurring.

The recommendation to senior leadership was to close technical loopholes and modify how delays were tracked for better future evaluation. This led to a 73% reduction in delay time for flights.
